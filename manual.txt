AnalysePlugin for NotePad++                                                DE 2013-01

This Plugin will help you to search for more than one search pattern at a time. 

Add the different search patterns to the configuration dialog and press [search]. 
As result you will find all matching lines in the result window and in the main 
window matching lines are marked. 
All patterns can have a different search type e.g. regular expression or normal 
text same as the find dialog in NotePad++ (see manual in "?")
Additionally you may want to blend out a sub set of a search pattern. For this 
you can check the "hide" option which results in hiding of that line or text from the
search result. The text is still there and clipboard copy will still hold all text. 
To hint that a line was found once, the line number remains in the result window.
You can also give the different searches colours to better distinguish which line 
belongs to which pattern. The colouring is done top line first and bottom line last. 
If a pattern is found twice, the lower pattern defines the colour. 
You can also give each line a comment e.g. what this pattern helps to find.
The Anaylse Configuration Dialog handles the list of search patterns. 
In this dialog you can adjust the different search patterns stacked into 
with following buttons:

---- Buttons ---- 
[Add]       Puts actual setting of the upper part into a new line in the table.
            If a line was marked in the table the line is added underneath.
[Update]    Copies the dialog data into the marked line of the table.
[Delete]    Removes the line actually marked.
[  ^  ]     Moves the selected pattern one step up in the list.
[  v  ]     Moves the selected pattern one step down in the list.
[Clear]     Removes all patterns and search result at once.
[Load]      Allows loading a list of search patterns from disk.
[Save]      Allows saving a list of search patterns to disk.
[Search]    Starts the search of all previously changed patterns.
            If no pattern exists the actual settings are made to one line
            of pattern. If only one line exists and actual settings are
            different, the line is updated before starting the search.

---- Search Options ---- 
Search Type:   Same as in find dialog; chose the type how to search.
               Here an interesting feature is that \r\n can be used
               to search for more than one line! Test it with normal
               find dialog in the editor and use the option "escaped".
               All types are the same as in normal NotePad++ find
               see also the help manual in menu "?" of NotePad++.
Case:          Same as in find dialog; case sensitive or not.
Whole Word:    Same as in find dialog; search for whole word or parts
Do Search:     Allows to temporarily switching off this pattern 
               (remove from search result).
Comment:       Useful for info what this pattern helps to find.

---- Visualization Options ---- 
These options can be updated without activating a re-search
Hide Text:     If on, the found pattern is removed from result line.
Colour FG/BG:  The result window text becomes coloured in 
               foreground and background herewith.
               If a result text is cached by several patterns, the 
               colour of the last pattern in list is used.
               The maximum of maintainable pattern colors is 119!
               All further patterns will get the default color.
Selection on:  Decides if found text or the whole line shall be 
               coloured / hidden.

---- Mouse Events ----
 - Configuration table -
Left mouse click     Copies the actual data of the clicked line into the 
                     configuration dialog for editing. click [update] to 
                     put the changes back to the marked line.
Double click         Toggles the current line to be searched or not.
Right mouse click    Opens the context menu.

 - Result window -
Double click         Moves the main window to the corresponding line
Right mouse click    Opens the context menu.
The find dialog in this window is optimized for the search patterns.
click on one of the currently defined patterns to search for this 
individually in the result window.

---- Analyse Plugin Configuration ---- 
The Analyse Plugin has an additional dialog for setting the config. In this dialog 
you can adjust the default values used in the find dialog at the startup of NotePad++.
In addition you can decide how the plugin shall react on pressing the search button 
(or Enter), when the search text has been modified. You may choose of either discard 
the modified text and 'just search'; in this case the modified search text will become
replaced with the text of the actually selected line's search text. 
If you choose 'update line' than the will be copied into the marked line and searched for. 
If your choice is 'add line' the modified search text will be taken as an additional 
search pattern and is amended to the search list. In this setting changing other options
will be treated like update line, as normally it does not make sense to search for the 
same text twice.

Hope you have much more fun to scan your tons of mega bytes long log files.
